# Library for reading/writing PSML

This is a library for serialising to, and deserialising from, PSML.
PSML is the [PageSeeder Markup Language](https://dev.pageseeder.com/psml/element_reference.html).

This crate doesn't guarantee total coverage of the spec, but feel free to open an issue if you need something that is not yet implemented.
