# Client for interacting with the PageSeeder API

This is an asynchronous, runtime-agnostic client for the [PageSeeder Service API](https://dev.pageseeder.com/api/services.html).

This crate doesn't cover all (or possibly even most) services, but feel free to open an issue if you need something that is not yet implemented.
