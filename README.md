# pageseeder-rs

Client library for [PageSeeder](https://pageseeder.com/).
Includes a mostly-complete model of the full [PSML spec](https://dev.pageseeder.com/psml/element_reference.html) in the `psml` module, and a best-effort API client in `pageseeder-api`.
This package is still under active development and is used in some internal Allette projects.
